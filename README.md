## By: Brady Graves
The purpose of this tutorial is for the people who want to protect their data and files the right way. 

The target audience is the people who do not have basic knowledge in protecting their data from malware, as a lot of people just seach up "anti-virus" software and download the first thing they see and call it good. 

 
 The internet is a scary place, with so much personal information being put online it is very importent to know how to protect yourself in this digital age. 
 Theres a couple easy ways that you can protect your important data that is on your computer. However we should first focus on why you might want to do this.
 
 If you notice that your computer is running slower than usual, or when you browse the internet you notice that pop ups are occuring more often, you might be needing to scan your computer for possible malware. 
Malware is software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Scary, right?
What's even more scary, is the increase of malware we have been seeing in the last couple of years, as according to phoenixNAP, Ransomware attacks have increased over 97% in the past year.
Ransomware is one of the most dangerous and most costly, as cybercriminals will hold your data hostage until you pay them a certain ammount of money, and then after you pay them you then have to hope you actually get your data back. 

With all that being said, how do you scan and protect your computer from malware?

1. The starting thing to do is to first download and run the microsoft windows malicious software removal tool. 

This tool is a free tool that is a great start when it comes to scanning your computer for malware, as it will check for known or common malware and remove it from your computer, 
unfortunantly though, this is not enough, as because of the everchanging world of cybersecurity, there is new malware being created each and everyday which calls for a much more in depth scan of your computer. 

2. There are several anti-virus programs that you can download and use for free to do a more in depth scan of your computer. 

Programs like Avast or AVG are **Fantastic** programs for cleaning your computer, as they will not only scan your computer when you ask them to, but will also scan in the background occasionally to ensure that you are always protected. 

3. If the last 2 steps do not work out, it might be time to bring out the big guns. Running a Complete virus scan. 

Some malware is hidden *very, very* deep in your computer that some anti-virus software cannot actually detect it. A great tool for this is Malwarebytes. Malwarebytes will go **Deep** into your files to see what exactly is infected. 
and remove it, ensuring that your data is safe and secure from outside threats. 


With all this information, it is still helpful to know how to ensure that you don't get these viruses.

1. Only click on links you absolutley trust, and double check the link to make sure that things like facebook.com are not spelled faecbook instead. Simple spelling discrepancies can go along way in a link, as some cybercriminals will create links to try to trick the average user. 

2. If the email is in your spam folder, it's most likely there for a reason. These emails are called spam for a reason, as their main purpose is to mislead the person reading them into doing something that they will regret. 

3. Make sure that you always have your anti-virus running in the background. These are called anti-virus for a reason, as they will alert you when you might be downloading something that can infect your computer, or will warn you before you click a link that it could be dangerous. 


## In the end, it is your responsability to keep your data safe and secure. The internet is a scary place with a lot of people trying to mislead you or steal from you. Using these tactics you can rest assured that your important data will be safe and there when you wake up the next morning.
